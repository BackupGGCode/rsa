# The **RSA** project #

This is an implementation of the _RSA cryptography algorithm_.

The project is written in standard C++ from scratch. It currently supports RSA encryption and decryption of files or strings, and RSA key generation. The goal of this project is to make a portable, easy to understand and complete implementation of the RSA algorithm.
